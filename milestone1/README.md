# Report

- The handwritten Ecore metamodel is in [features_modeling](../project/features_modeling/model/features_modeling.ecore).
- The handwritten Xtext grammar is in [org.xtext.example.featureModel](../project/org.xtext.example.featureModel/src/org/xtext/example/mydsl/FeatureModel.xtext).
- Examples are in this directory.

## Comparison

The handwritten Ecore model is written from the formal definition while the
Xtext grammar was conceived mainly by looking at the diagram example.
